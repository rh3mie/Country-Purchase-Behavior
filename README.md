Project that aims to analyze global purchase behavior from the years 2020-2023. The dataset included age, gender, country, purchase amount, purchase date, and purchase category. This project focused mainly on data loading, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis. I wanted to focus mainly on exploring how factors such as demographic and region might affect purchase behavior, providing insights to when a company might want to promote advertising or certain products.
